# Kyrios: A Modern Systems Programming Language

Welcome to Kyrios!

Kyrios is a modern systems programming language designed to provide a safe, efficient, and easy-to-use platform for building high-performance applications. With a focus on concurrency, parallelism, and memory safety, Kyrios aims to revolutionize the way we write systems software.

## Features

- **Concurrency and Parallelism**: Kyrios provides built-in support for concurrency and parallelism, making it easy to write high-performance applications that take advantage of multi-core processors.
- **Memory Safety**: Kyrios features a robust memory safety system that prevents common programming errors such as null pointer dereferences and data races.
- **Error Handling**: Kyrios provides a comprehensive error handling system that makes it easy to write robust and reliable code.
- **Dynamic Typing**: Kyrios uses dynamic typing, allowing for greater flexibility and ease of use, while still maintaining the performance and safety of a statically-typed language.

## Getting Started

To get started with Kyrios, follow these steps:

1. **Install the Kyrios compiler**: You can download the Kyrios compiler from our [website](#) or install it using your package manager.
2. **Write your first Kyrios program**: Create a new file with a `.ky` extension and start writing your Kyrios code.
3. **Compile and run your program**: Use the Kyrios compiler to compile your program and run it using the `ky` command.

## Example Code

Here is an example of a simple Kyrios program:

```ky
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = 10;
    println!("The sum is: {}", x + y);
}
